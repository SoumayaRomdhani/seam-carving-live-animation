# 🎞 Seam Carving Live Animation — Content-Aware Image Resizing (Streamlit)

This project is an interactive **Streamlit web app** that demonstrates **Seam Carving**, a famous technique for **content-aware image resizing**.  
Unlike naive resizing (stretching/shrinking), Seam Carving removes *low-energy* pixel paths (**seams**) while preserving important objects in the image.

---

##  Objective

Resize an image **without destroying the important content** (faces, objects, edges).  
Visualize the algorithm **step-by-step** with:

- **Original image**
- **Naive resizing** (normal browser resizing)
- **Content-aware resized image** (seam carving)
- **Energy map + seam overlay**

##  What is Seam Carving?

Seam Carving removes **one seam at a time**:

- A **seam** is a connected path of pixels from:
  - **top → bottom** (vertical seam)
  - **left → right** (horizontal seam)

At each iteration:

1. Compute an **energy map**
2. Find the **minimum-energy seam**
3. Remove the seam
4. Repeat `k` times

This keeps the most important regions (**high-energy areas**) untouched.

##  Energy Map

Energy represents pixel importance (edges/details).

In this project, energy is computed with Sobel gradients:

- **Energy = |Sobel_x| + |Sobel_y|**

** High energy ⇒ important pixels  
** Low energy ⇒ pixels that can be removed safely

---

##  Dynamic Programming (Minimum Seam)

To find the best seam efficiently, we use **Dynamic Programming**:

- Build a cumulative energy matrix `M`
- For each pixel, choose the minimum of the **3 pixels above** (left / up / right)
- Backtrack from the bottom row to recover the seam path

Complexity (per seam):

- Time: **O(H × W)**
- Space: **O(H × W)**
